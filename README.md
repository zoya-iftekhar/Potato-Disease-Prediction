# Potato Disease Classification

## Overview

The Potato Disease Classification project aims to automate the detection and classification of diseases affecting potato crops. Using advanced deep learning techniques, this project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow to analyze images of potato plants and identify various diseases. The solution is designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in timely disease detection and management, ultimately improving crop yield and quality.

## Key Components

### 1. Deep Learning Model

- **Framework:** TensorFlow
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Purpose:** To classify images of potato plants into categories based on observed diseases. The model is trained on a diverse dataset with various disease conditions, utilizing data augmentation techniques to enhance its performance and generalization.

### 2. Data Augmentation

- **Techniques Used:** Rotation, flipping, scaling, and color adjustment.
- **Goal:** To create a more robust model by generating variations of the original training data. This helps the model generalize better to new, unseen images and improves its ability to handle real-world scenarios where images may vary in quality and appearance.

### 3. Backend API

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Functionality:** Provides an interface for the frontend and other services to interact with the deep learning model. The API handles image uploads, processes them through the trained model, and returns the classification results. FastAPI is chosen for its speed and ease of use in creating RESTful APIs.

### 4. Frontend Application

- **Framework:** React Native
- **Features:** 
  - Allows users to upload images of potato plants.
  - Displays the classification results and provides actionable insights based on the detected disease.
  - Designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily navigate and interact with the application on mobile devices.

### 5. Deployment

- **Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Components:**
  - **Compute Engine or App Engine:** Hosts the FastAPI backend to handle API requests and serve the model.
  - **Cloud Storage:** Stores the trained model and other necessary assets.
  - **Firebase or Expo:** Used for deploying the React Native application, enabling easy updates and maintenance.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload images of potato plants through the React Native app.
2. **API Request:** The image is sent to the FastAPI backend.
3. **Model Inference:** The backend processes the image using the TensorFlow CNN model.
4. **Result:** The backend returns the classification results to the frontend, which then displays them to the user.

## Benefits

- **Early Detection:** Helps in identifying potato diseases at an early stage, allowing for timely intervention.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced deep learning techniques for accurate disease classification.
- **Accessibility:** Mobile application provides ease of use for farmers and agricultural workers in the field.
